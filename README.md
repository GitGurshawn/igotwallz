## IGOTWALLZ
Website created with React that shows common wallbang spots on the game Valorant, developed by Riot Games. Here is the link: IGOTWALLZ.com

## How to use
Once on the homepage, click on the map you want to see. You will be redirected to another page that has the game's map image with icons scattered all over it. Click on any of the icons to display a video that shows how the wallbang is done in-game. Click on the map buttons on the bottom right corner of the page to switch maps.
